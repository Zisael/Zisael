Hi, I'm a software developer who also enjoys working on some private leisure projects outside of actual work.

Favourite language is Python, but I'm also somewhat proficient in: JavaScript & Typescript, Java, SQL; 
I actually enjoy writing and testing regular expressions, so I would be glad to help with those.

I'm also an avid gamer - mostly JRPG, Strategy RPG and Roguelikes, but I'm privy to almost any genre outside of FPS, RTS and MOBAs. 

Always looking for constructive feedback, so feel free to direct any my way if you feel so inclined :)
